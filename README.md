Welcome to the **Seamless Upgrade Toolbox** repo. In this repo, you will find several applications enabling you to test the proper running of PrestaShop upgrades (including Core, modules, themes, dependencies). Here is the list of tools currently available:

## Autoupgrade scripts

The script allows testing the upgrade between 2 versions of PrestaShop, with the possibility of:
- create a database dump and comparing it with a dump from a fresh install
- create file hashes and comparing it with another hashes from a fresh install

## Autoupgrade rollback scripts

- create file hashes before upgrade and comparing it with another hashes created after the rollback
